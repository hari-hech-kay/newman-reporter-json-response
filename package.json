  "description": "JSON Reporter which cuts out a bunch of unnecessary items in the **Newman JSON report** and also provides **JSON response body** for responses with Content-Type as *application/json*.

It still uses JSON.stringify, but since it has a fraction of the data it is far less likely to run into 'RangeError: Invalid string length",
